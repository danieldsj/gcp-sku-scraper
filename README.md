# gcp-sku-scraper
A python script the scapes VM Family information from the [GCP SKU Groups page](https://cloud.google.com/skus/sku-groups) and combines it with information from the Billing API for [services](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/reference/rest/v1/services) and [skus](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/reference/rest/v1/services.skus) to generate CSV files. The script assumes there is a `key.secret` file containing an [API key](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys#creating_an_api_key) in the same directory.
